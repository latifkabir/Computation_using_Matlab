      COLLOCATION <br> Simple Examples of Collocation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COLLOCATION</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      exemplifies the collocation method, a general technique which 
      begins with an equation satisfied by a function f(x) defined over a 
      continuous domain, and uses collocation to produce a function g(x)
      from some specified collocation function space, which solves the equation 
      exactly, but only at a discrete set of points.
    </p>

    <p>
      While some functional equations can be solved exactly, a computational
      technique must generally be designed to deal with a discrete set of
      data.  The hope is that, if the correct family of collocation spaces
      is chosen, and enough points are used, and are wisely placed, that
      the collocation function g(x) will converge to the unknown function f(x),
      and will do so rapidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most common example of collocation is <i>interpolation</i>, which
      comes in two versions:
      <ol>
        <li>
          at a prescribed set of N points X(I), values Y(I) are given;
          construct a g(x) such that g(x(i))=y(i).  The only choice the
          user has, then, is the method for transforming N pairs of data
          into a function defined for all X.  
        </li>
        <li>
          at any point X, a value Y(X) may be requested.  Determine the
          number of points N, and suitable locations for the points X,
          and then construct a g(x) such that g(x(i))=y(i).  Since N
          and X are selectable by the user, the idea is to make these choices
          efficiently (not too many) and effectively (so that g(x) is a
          good approximation to f(x), even at points where the value
          Y(X) was not requested in advance.)
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      A more involved case involves two point boundary value problems.
      Here, a function y(x) is supposed to exist over an interval [a,b],
      with known values at the endpoints, satisfying a second order differential
      equation in between, which might have the form:
      <pre>
        y(a) = ya
        y''(x) = f(x) for a < x < b
        y(b) = yb
      </pre>
      A collocation approach would select N points between A and B,
      represent the collocation function G(X) in some way that involves
      N unknown coefficients, and then write out the collocation equations
      as a linear system that can be solved for the coefficients.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, if we take the interval to be [0,4], F(X) to be EXP(X),
      and use N = 5 points, equally spaced, and assume G(X) has the form 
      C0+C1*X+C2*X^2+C3*X^3+C4*X^4, our collocation equations become:
      <pre>
        C0 + C1 * 0 +     C2 * 0^2 +     C3 * 0^3 +      C4 * 0^4 = YA
                      2 * C2       + 6 * C3 * 1^1 + 12 * C4 * 1^2 = EXP(1)
                      2 * C2       + 6 * C3 * 2^1 + 12 * C4 * 2^2 = EXP(2)
                      2 * C2       + 6 * C3 * 3^1 + 12 * C4 * 3^2 = EXP(3)
        C0 + C1 * 4 +     C2 * 4^2 +     C3 * 4^3 +      C4 * 4^4 = Yb
      </pre>
      which can be rewritten as:
      <pre>
        | 1   0   0   0   0 |   C0      YA
        | 0   0   2   6  12 |   C1      EXP(1)
        | 0   0   2  12  48 | * C2  =   EXP(2)
        | 0   0   2  18 108 |   C3      EXP(3)
        | 1   4  16  64 256 |   C4      YB
      </pre>
      and this linear system can be solved for C, so that we know
      the form of our collocation function G(X).
