COLLOCATION_TEST
  MATLAB version.
  Test the COLLOCATION library.

COLLOCATION_TEST01:
  Collocate the equation F(X)=SIN(X)
  Let N be the number of collocation points.
  Choose N points X in [0,2Pi].
  Let G(X) be a polynomial of degree N-1.
    G(X(1:N)) = SIN(X(1:N))
  is N equations for the N unknown coefficients in G.

COLLOCATION_TEST02:
  Collocate a two point boundary value problem.
  Let N be the number of collocation points.
  Choose N points X in [0,2].
  Let G(X) be a polynomial of degree N-1.
    G(X(1)=0.0) = 1.0
    G"(X(2:N-1)) = G(X(2:N-1))
    G(X(N)=2.0) = exp(2.0)
  is N equations for the N unknown coefficients in G.

COLLOCATION_TEST03:
  Collocate a two point boundary value problem.
  Let N be the number of collocation points.
  Choose N points X in [0,2].
  Let G(X) be C1+C2*X+C(3:N)*SIN((1:N-2)*PI*X/(N-2)).
    G(X(1)=0.0) = 1.0
    G"(X(2:N-1)) = G(X(2:N-1))
    G(X(N)=2.0) = exp(2.0)
  is N equations for the N unknown coefficients in G.
