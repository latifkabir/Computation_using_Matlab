%% OWN_E_SIZE Open Weakly Nested Exponential Growth.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This calculation assumes that an exponential growth rule is being used,
%    that is, that the 1D rules have orders 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on.
%
%    This calculation assumes that the 1D family of quadrature rules 
%    contains only one repeated point, presumably the value 0.0.
%    This assumption holds for Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Hermite and 
%    Generalized Gauss-Hermite rules.
%
%    The routine then counts the number of unique abscissas that will
%    be generated for a sparse grid of given dimension and level.
%
%    The computation is complicated.  It starts by counting just those
%    abscissas which have no 0.0 in them.  This is relatively easy, since
%    it is like counting the points in a sparse grid that uses open 
%    non-nested rules, but for which the order of each rule is reduced by 1.
%
%    Then we have to count the abscissas with one 0.0, two 0.0's and so
%    on to DIM_NUM zeros.  We are assuming this is an isotropic grid,
%    so for a particular number K of zeroes we only need to count the case
%    where the first K entries are zero, and multiply by C(DIM_NUM,K).
%
%    To count the number of entries with K zeroes, (and assuming 0 < K),
%    then, we essentially count the number of abscissas in an open 
%    non-nested rule as before, but modifed so that the minimum level is 0,
%    rather than LEVEL_MAX - DIM_NUM + 1.
%
%    I will mention that this was a rather difficult computation to
%    figure out!
