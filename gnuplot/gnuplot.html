      GNUPLOT <br> Programs that Set Up GNUPLOT Graphics
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GNUPLOT</b> 
      is a set of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how commands and data for the GNUPLOT graphics program
      can be generated, to illustrate the results of a calculation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Ordinarily, GNUPLOT is used interactively; that is, the user
      invokes the program, and then describes the plot to be created.
      The data for the plot is created either by a formula, or by
      reference to some data file created earlier.  
    </p>

    <p>
      It is often extremely important to be able to create graphical
      images of the results of an executable program.  If the user is
      familiar with GNUPLOT, then the program can be modified to create
      a suitable data file, and, once the program has completed,
      the user can run GNUPLOT and use that data file to create a graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if the program is going to create the data file, it can
      just as easily create a file containing the appropriate commands
      to GNUPLOT that will create the desired image.  In this way, 
      the user can avoid having to recall the correct commands in the
      correct order to create the plot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the program might create two files, called, perhaps
      <i>data.txt</i> and <i>commands.txt</i>.  The command file would
      contain GNUPLOT commands, including one that refers to the data file
      itself.  To create the graphics image, the user would simply type
      <pre>
        gnuplot &lt; commands.txt
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      This directory includes some sample programs which carry out 
      numerical calculations, creating data and command files that
      are used in exactly this way.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the way, every time I run gnuplot, I get the obnoxious warning
      message
      <pre>
Could not find/open font when opening font "arial", using internal non-scalable font
      </pre>
      I had to fix this with the following lines added to my .bashrc file:
      <pre>
export GDFONTPATH=/usr/share/fonts/liberation
export GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT=LiberationSans-Regular
      </pre>
