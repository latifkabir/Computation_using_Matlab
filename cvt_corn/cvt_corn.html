      CVT_CORN <br> Model Cell Growth in a Corn Kernel
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CVT_CORN</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      studies a 2D model of the growth of a corn kernel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program treats the surface and interior biological cells as points to be 
      organized by a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT)
      with a nonuniform density; during a sequence of growth steps,
      new biological cells are randomly added to the surface and interior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are two photomicrographs of <a href = "corn_radial.png">a radial slice</a>
      and <a href = "corn_transverse.png">a transverse slice</a> through a corn kernel.
      These pictures were an inspiration for the study done here.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program models the corn kernel as a circle.  There is a layer of surface
      cells on the circumference of the circle, and a collection of interior cells
      within the circle.  Each cell is marked, that is, it knows what kind of cell
      it is, and this marker is never changed.  Each cell is modeled by a single
      geometric point.  The extent of a surface cell is the set of circumference
      points closer to it than to any other circumference cell.  The extent of an
      interior cell is the set of interior points closer to it than to any
      other interior cell.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cells may move.  Surface cells may move along the circumference.  Interior
      cells may move within the interior.
    </p>

    <p>
      We presume that the cells adjust their positions in accordance with the
      energy minimization principle.  Briefly, this means that each cell's
      preferred location is the centroid of its extent.   Surface cells may
      only move to the projection of their centroid on the circumference. 
    </p>

    <p>
      If we move each cell to its centroid, the extent of the cell changes,
      and hence the centroid changes.  An iteration can be carried out in
      which we compute centroids and move cells to their centroids.  This 
      iteration will in general approach what is known as a
      Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT).
    </p>

    <p>
      By the specification of a nonuniform density function, the calculation
      of the centroid can be influenced in such a way that cells tend to
      cluster preferentially in certain regions.  For the corn kernel, we
      can apply such a density function which will tend to push cells
      away from the circle center.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a rough model of growth, once we have completed a CVT iteration,
      we may begin a new step by allowing cells to "bud".  Surface and 
      cells are each given a probability of budding.  We then compute
      which cells have budded.  Surface cells can give birth to another surface
      cell, or to an interior cell.  Once the new cells have been created, and positioned
      very close to their parents, another CVT iteration is carried out.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program uses some parameters which the user can monitor or set:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ALG</b>, the CVT update algorithm:
          <ul>
            <li>
              1 = update circle + disk together.
            </li>
            <li>
              2 = update circle only, then update disk only.
            </li>
            <li>
              3 = update circle only, then update circle + disk together.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NB</b>, the number of points on boundary;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NI</b>, number of point in interior;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NP</b>, total number of points;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NS</b>, number of sample points for Lloyd's algorithm;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PR_BUD</b>, probability that a boundary point will create a bud;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PR_BUD_ANGULAR</b>, probability that boundary bud is constrained to the boundary;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R</b>, the radius of the circle;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SEED</b>, the initial random number seed;
        </li>
