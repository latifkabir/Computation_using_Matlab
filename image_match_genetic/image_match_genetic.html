      IMAGE_MATCH_GENETIC <br> Approximate an Image Using a Genetic Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_MATCH_GENETIC</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      approximates a 256x256 JPG image by blending just 32 rectangles of arbitrary
      position and color, using ideas from genetic algorithms,
      based on an example by Nick Berry.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Nick Berry's example, he started with a 256x256 RGB image of himself.
      He considered the problem of reconstructing this image using 32 rectangles,
      each having an RGB color, and each having an arbitrary location.
      Thus, an attempt to approximate the original image can be described by
      32 pieces of information, each of which involves 7 data items, namely
      3 colors, and 4 coordinate
      values, that is, the locations of the lower left and upper right corners of
      the rectangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the X and Y ranges of our image are 0 to 255, and our RGB ranges are
      also 0 to 255, each of our 7 data items can be described by an 8 bit binary
      integer.  So we can imagine that we can describe an approximate solution
      using 32 x 7 * 8 bits of information.
    </p>

    <p>
      We might refer to an approximate solution as a "candidate", or the solution's "DNA".
      We might refer to the information describing a single rectangle as a "chromosome",
      and the 7 data items as "genes".  Then the 8 bits in a gene are the fundamental
      items of genetic information.
    </p>

    <p>
      A genetic algorithm tries to solve the image matching problem by starting with a
      random population of 10 sets of DNA.  A fitness function is used to identify the
      best and worst DNA.  In our case, this fitness function might simply be the sum
      of the differences between the original and approximate RGB images.
    </p>

    <p>
      We then modify our population by:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>death</i>, the two worst candidates are discarded;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>mutations</i>, one of the intermediate candidates has a single genetic bit flipped.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>crossover</i>, the two best candidates are crossed, creating two children whose
          DNA is a mix of that of the two parents's.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The new population is evaluated for fitness, and the modification process is repeated
      many times, in the hope that approximations of increasing fitness will be discovered.
