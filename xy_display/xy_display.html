      Display 2D Points in the MATLAB Graphics Window

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>XY_DISPLAY</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      reads a set of 2D
      points from a file and plots them in the MATLAB graphics window.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file containing the point coordinates is in the <b>XY</b>
      format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The MATLAB command <b>scatter</b>
      is used to display the points.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>xy_display</b> ( <i>'filename.xy'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'filename.xy'</i> is a file containing a list of point coordinates
        </li>
      </ul>
      reads the point coordinate data in <i>'filename.xy'</i> and
      displays a plot of the points.
