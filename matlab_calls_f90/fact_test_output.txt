FACT_TEST
  Demonstrate a simple use of the MEX compiler,
  which allows MATLAB to call FORTRAN77 functions.

  Get a directory listing.  The file FACT.F should,
  show up here.

cheby_u.f  cheby_u_test.m  fact.f  fact.mexglx	fact_test.m  matlab_f77.html

  Compile the file FACT.F.

  Get a directory listing.  A new file should show up,
  containing the compiled information.

cheby_u.f  cheby_u_test.m  fact.f  fact.mexglx	fact_test.m  matlab_f77.html

  Now use FACT as though it were a MATLAB M-file function.
