    <p>
      <b>XYL_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      reads XYL information
      containing a list of 2D point coordinates, and the indices of points
      that form lines, and displays a plot in the MATLAB graphics window.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>xyl_display</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>'prefix'</i> is the common file prefix
        </li>
      </ul>
      reads the point coordinate data in <i>'prefix.xy'</i> and
      the line information in <i>'prefix.xyl'</i>, and displays a plot of the points
      and lines.
