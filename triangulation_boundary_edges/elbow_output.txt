TRIANGULATION_BOUNDARY_EDGES
  MATLAB version
  Identify triangulation edges on the boundary.

* Read a dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions;
* Read an associated triangulation dataset of  
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes;
* Determine which edges are on the boundary;
* Write a file: segment_index, node1_index, node2_index.

  Read the header of "elbow_nodes.txt".
  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM = 2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM  = 319
  Read the data in "elbow_nodes.txt".

  Read the header of "elbow_elements.txt".
  Triangle order = 3
  Number of triangles = 568
  Read the data in "elbow_elements.txt".

  Wrote the boundary edge file "elbow_boundary_edges.txt".
