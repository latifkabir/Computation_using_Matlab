    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_BOUNDARY_EDGES</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      analyzes the triangulation of a region, identifies the edges that
      form the boundaries, organizes the boundary edges into one or more
      connected components, and writes a file describing the components
      and the sequence of boundary edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Either a 3-node or 6-node triangulation may be used.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangulation_boundary_edges</b> ( <i>'prefix'</i> )
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common filename prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b> contains the node coordinates,
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b> contains the element definitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_boundary_edges.txt</b> 
          is a file created by the program.  Each line lists a component
          index, and a pair of node indices.
        </li>
      </ul>
