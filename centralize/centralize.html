      CENTRALIZE <br> Estimate a Centroid In Arbitrary Dimension
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CENTRALIZE</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which
      estimates the centroid and radius of a shape, or a set of data points, 
      in a space of arbitrary dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      We may have been given a way to random sample the shape;
      we may have been given an organized way to sample; we may
      have a function that can be evaluated to determine what points
      belong to the shape.  We may already know that the shape
      is a sphere, ellipse, polytope or convex body.  There may be
      a weight or a weight function associated with points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest approach estimates the centroid of the shape
      as the average of the sampled points, and the radius as the
      average distance of the samples to the estimated centroid.
      It is interesting to observe the behavior of the error of
      such an estimate for a fixed number of sample points as
      the spatial dimension increases.
