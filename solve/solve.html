      SOLVE <br> Linear Solver for Double Dimensioned Arrays
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SOLVE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      solves a linear system of equations A*x=b using Gauss elimination.
    </p>

    <p>
      In MATLAB, of course, one can simply type "x = A\b" and get an
      answer, even if the matrix is ill-conditioned, singular, complex,
      rectangular (over-determined or under-determined).
    </p>

    <p>
      Nonetheless, this library is useful because:
      <ul>
        <li>
          it shows the steps involved in a simple Gauss-elimination procedure;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used to count the number of operations in Gauss-elimination;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a guide for writing a corresponding program
          in a non-MATLAB environment;
        </li>
        <li>
          its performance can be compared to corresponding versions in C
          or Fortran;
        </li>
        <li>
          it can be used as a starting point for exploring band storage,
          sparse storage, iterative solutions and other topics in linear 
          algebra.
        </li>
      </ul>
