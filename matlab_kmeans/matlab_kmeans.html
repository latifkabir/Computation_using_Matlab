    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_KMEANS</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      illustrates how MATLAB's kmeans() command can be used to handle
      the K-Means problem, which organizes a set of N points in M dimensions 
      into K clusters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because kmeans() is a built-in function in MATLAB, you can examine
      its source code by starting MATLAB and then typing
      <blockquote>
        edit kmeans
      </blockquote>
