HYPERSPHERE_SURFACE_TEST:
  Test functions in the HYPERSPHERE_SURFACE library.

INTERIOR_POINT_CHARACTERISTIC_TEST
  INTERIOR_POINT_CHARACTERISTIC seeks a point "inside" an object
  for which a characteristic function has been provided.
  We also assume that a hyperrectangle has been specified
  which contains the search region.

  Interior point:

     1:     0.644318
     2:     0.378609

EXTERIOR_POINT_CHARACTERISTIC_TEST
  EXTERIOR_POINT_CHARACTERISTIC seeks a point "outside" an object
  for which a characteristic function has been provided.
  We assume that we have been given a base point X0, which
  is an interior point, that is, F(X0) = 1.
  We also assume we have been given a direction, specified
  by the vector THETA, and measured from X0, along which
  we are to search for the exterior point.

  Interior point:

     1:     0.422886
     2:    0.0942293

  Exterior point:

     1:     0.422886
     2:      1.09423

CIRCLE_PLOTS:
  For a 2D circle defined by a 0/1 characteristic function,
  plot the surface, and R(Theta),
  using a centered point, and then an offcentered point.

  Created plotfile "circle_centered_surface.png".
  Created plotfile "circle_centered_plot.png".
  Created plotfile "circle_offcentered_surface.png".
  Created plotfile "circle_offcentered_plot.png".

TRIANGLE_PLOTS:
  For a 2D triangle defined by a 0/1 characteristic function,
  plot the surface, and R(Theta),
  using a centered point, and then an offcentered point.

  Created plotfile "triangle_centered_surface.png".
  Created plotfile "triangle_centered_plot.png".
  Created plotfile "triangle_offcentered_surface.png".
  Created plotfile "triangle_offcentered_plot.png".

HYPERSPHERE_SURFACE_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
