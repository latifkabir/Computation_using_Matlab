      HYPERSPHERE_SURFACE <br> Estimate Hypersurface Location
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HYPERSPHERE_SURFACE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      investigates a procedure for estimating the location of points on a
      hypersurface implicitly defined by a characteristic function or by
      a signed function.
    </p>

    <p>
      In M dimensions, a characteristic function F for a region of points S
      has the property that F(X) is 1 for points inside S, and 0
      otherwise.  A characteristic function is thus discontinous.  
      The set of discontinuity points for F is the boundary of S.
    </p>

    <p>
      In M dimensions, suppose that the function F, presumably continuous,
      takes on both positive and negative values.  Then we may be interested
      in the set of points X such that F(X) = 0, which we regard as the
      boundary between the sets where F is negative or positive.  Assuming 
      that F is continuous, or better yet, differentiable, then this boundary 
      may be substantially easier to locate than in the characteristic function 
      case.
