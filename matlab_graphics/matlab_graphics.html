    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_GRAPHICS</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how to achieve relatively simple graphics effects
      that are TRIVIAL when using a pencil, SIMPLE when using any 
      standard graphics package, but seem to be IMPOSSIBLE
      when struggling with MATLAB's stunningly elaborate and awkward
      graphics system.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love MATLAB, I really do, but if the default behavior of MATLAB's
      graphic system doesn't work for you, it seems to me excruciatingly
      painful to discover a technique for getting what you want - moreover,
      there rarely seems to be a sensible logical structure to explain
      what is going on, nor a systematic procedure for building an image.

      Source Code:
    </h3>

    <p>
      You plot a circle, and it comes out an ellipse.  What is going on?
      Briefly, MATLAB uses a rectangle to display your plot.  It takes
      the X and Y ranges of your data, and stretches them along the horizontal
      and vertical directions of the rectangle.  This guarantees that a
      plot that is logically square will be displayed as a rectangle, 
      and thus a circle becomes an ellipse.  Luckily, the "axis equal"
      command helps.  MATLAB still plots inside a rectangle, but now
      it stretches your X and Y data by the same single scale factor,
      resulting in some new white space to the left and right of your
      plot of a perfect circle.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "circle_test.m">circle_test.m</a>,
          a program that plots a circle twice, the second time using
          the "axis square" command.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "circle_test01.png">circle_test01.png</a>,
          the first circle (which looks like an ellipse).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "circle_test02.png">circle_test02.png</a>,
          the second version of the circle, which looks OK.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Surprisingly, a typical MATLAB plot can involve a lot of empty
      space.  In the simple case where you are plotting a circle, you
      will get white space in the grid region itself if you enforce
      equal axis units, since MATLAB wants to display the grid within
      a rectangle.  But you will also get a substantial margin of white
      space around the plot area itself.  This can be annoying when you
      are trying to prepare graphics for use in a publication, or
      if you want to put several images side by side - the white space,
      which contains no information, eats up lots of space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Can you cut back that white space?  In particular, if you want to
      plot a circle (or anything else whose shape doesn't correspond to
      MATLAB's "golden rectangle"), can you make an image that is
      mathematically correct, and economic in terms of wasted white space?
    </p>

    <p>
      You may try various combinations of "axis equal", "axis square",
      "axis tight", "axis ( [0,1,0,1] )" and so on, all the time coming
      halfway to your goal, without ever actually achieving an image 
      that is square (or whatever aspect ratio you want), doesn't have 
      wasted graph space, and doesn't have that excessive margin around 
      the plot.
    </p>

    <p>
      After wasting a lot of time, I stumbled across a few commands that,
      used together, seem to achieve the correct result.  However, in my
      case, the image still looks rectangular in the MATLAB interactive
      viewer - but comes out nice and square in the PNG image rendered 
      by the PRINT command.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "trim_test.m">trim_test.m</a>,
          a program that plots a circle twice, the second time 
          with the "fat" trimmed off.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "trim_test01.png">trim_test01.png</a>,
          the first version of the circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "trim_test02.png">trim_test02.png</a>,
          the second version of the circle.
