      GRAY_CODE_DISPLAY <br> Display Hamming Distances for Binary and Gray Codes
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GRAY_CODE_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      computes the Hamming distance tables for both the binary and Gray codes,
      and displays 3D plots that illustrate how the Gray code does a better job
      of providing nearby representations for nearby numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the numbers 0 through N.
      We can represent them using the binary code or the Gray code.
      Both codes can be thought of as vectors of M binary digits.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hamming distance between two vectors counts the number
      of digits that are different.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the binary code, the Hamming distance between two M vectors
      that represent consecutive integers can be any value from 1 to M.
      However, if we use the Gray code, this Hamming distance is always 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, this fact implies that the Hamming distance between Gray codes for 
      integers that are 2 places apart is 2, 3 places apart is 3 or less, and in general
      for integers K places apart, the Hamming distance between the
      Gray codes will be no more than K.
    </p>

    <p>
      The property that nearby integers have nearby Gray codes can be
      a very useful fact, for example, when using genetic algorithms,
      where small differences in the object should be accomplishable 
      by small changes in the "genes".
    </p>

    <p>
      This program computes and compares the Hamming distance matrices
      for the binary and Gray codes.  Note that for the Gray code,
      there is an obvious smooth valley running along the diagonal.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plots of the distance matrices are created by code that was
      extracted from the program <b>quad_mesh_order1_display()</b>.
