      MATLAB_COMPILER <br> Creating Standalone Executables from MATLAB Programs
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MATLAB_COMPILER</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate the use of the MATLAB compiler, which allows you
      to create a compiled version of a MATLAB application which
      can then be run outside the MATLAB environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The compiled program can be used on another computer or by another
      user, who need not have a licensed copy of MATLAB.  As long as
      the compiled program can be linked with the Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR)
      library, it can be executed.  Thus, before compiling a user program,
      one must first make sure that the MCR is available on the target
      computer where the executable is to be run.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      One unexpected use for the MATLAB compiler is on computer clusters,
      where a user program will be executed on an arbitrary node.  This
      node might not have access to the MATLAB license server, and thus,
      ordinarily, a MATLAB program could not run there.  However, it is
      a relatively simple matter to make the MCR available to any node,
      and thus a MATLAB program can be compiled on the front end or
      interactive area of the computer cluster, using a licensed copy
      of MATLAB; the compiled executable can then be submitted to a
      batch queue for execution on a remote node with MCR.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before the first time you want to use the compiler, you
      must run a setup command that allows MATLAB to select the
      options appropriate for the given version of MATLAB and the
      system where compilation is being carried out.  To do this,
      start MATLAB, and issue the command:
      <pre>
        mbuild -setup
      </pre>
      You may have to respond to one or two questions before the
      setup is completed.
    </p>

      Creating an Executable:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To create the executable, you start up MATLAB, and then type
      <pre>
        deploytool
      </pre>
      which opens up a little GUI with two tabs, NEW and OPEN. 
      Since we're creating something, we want to work on the NEW tab,
      which is probably already visible.  On the NEW tab, there
      are three items, NAME, LOCATION, and TYPE.  In the NAME field,
      you can enter a name to give your application; let's say we name it
      "magicsquare".  Under TYPE, you probably want to choose
      "Standalone application", which is probably the default choice anyway.
      Clicking OK finishes this part of the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should now see your MATLAB window includes a work area
      titled "Standalone Application".  There should be a tab called
      BUILD, with an item called "(Add main file)".  Click on this,
      to get a window that allows you to select the file that is to
      act as the main program for your application.  (Let's say our
      main file is called "magicsquare.m").  If this main
      program calls other M-files that you have written, and they
      are in the MATLAB path, they will be included automatically
      at compile time.  So in the simplest case, once you have identified
      the main program, we are almost done.
    </p>

    <p>
      To cause the compilation to occur, you must click on the
      build icon, which is NOT visible as a word, but rather as 
      a tiny icon near the upper right corner of the Standalone
      Application window.  I thought it looked like a little birthday
      cake with candles...Click on this, and the compilation will
      begin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the compilation is completed, you will discover that a
      directory has been created, perhaps called "magicsquare".
      If we want to execute the compiled program, we will need to
      look at this directory.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Running an Executable:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Compiling your MATLAB application created a directory,
      whose name was specified by you.
      Inside this directory are two subdirectories, "src" and "distrib".
      The "distrib" directory contains the compiled information you
      can execute on another computer, or that you can send to a friend
      or colleague who does not have a copy of MATLAB.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the distrib directory for "magicsquare", I found three items:
      <ul>
        <li>
          readme.txt, some complicated instructions;
        </li>
        <li>
          magic_example, the (almost) executable program.
        </li>
        <li>
          run_magic_example.sh, a shell script which can
          run the executable program.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The executable file is "almost" executable because it cannot
      run without some extra information; in particular, it needs
      to know the directory containing the MATLAB Compiler Runtime library
      (MCR).  On my system, all the MATLAB information is stored in
      the directory /usr/local/matlab.  The shell script can be used
      to run the executable file, feeding it the information about
      the directory, as well as any necessary commandline arguments.
      For instance, the magicsquare example can be run by:
      <pre>
        ./run_magic_example.sh /usr/local/matlab 5
      </pre>
      Here, the "5" is the commandline input to the function that
      tells it the size of the desired magic square.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      What Was the Point?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Now, I could have printed out a magic square hours ago by calling
      MATLAB's magic function directly.  Or I could have run my
      magicsquare.m function.  What have I gained by creating this
      almost executable file?
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose my laptop at home does not have a copy of MATLAB installed.
      I can take my almost executable file, and the shell script home.
      I can then run my MATLAB program there ... without MATLAB!  
      Now actually, before I do that, I have to make sure I've installed
      the MCR on my home laptop, but that can be freely downloaded 
      from the Mathworks website, perhaps at
      <a href = "http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/">
                 http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/</a>. 
      When I run my shell script on my laptop, I must again note
      where the MCR is on this machine, which might be /usr/local/matlab
      again, or perhaps some other directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now suppose I have a colleague in another country, who
      uses a different kind of computer, and doesn't have MATLAB.
      I can send that colleague, by email, my compiled file,
      and if she can install the MCR, she can run my program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, note that many people have access to a computer cluster.
      The computer cluster may have a front end where people are encouraged
      to edit, compile and work interactively, and many back end or 
      remote nodes, where only computation takes place.  For various
      reasons, it is possible that MATLAB will be installed on the front
      end, but not on the remote nodes.  For instance, the remote nodes
      may not be able to communicate with the MATLAB license server;
      or MATLAB may not be licensed to run on the remote nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      That means that you can't create a batch job for a remote node
      to execute a MATLAB function for you, whose "interesting" line
      might be
      <pre>
        /usr/local/matlab < my_prog.m > my_output.txt
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, the MATLAB compiler comes to the rescue.  Assuming that
      your system administrator will install the MCR on the remote nodes,
      which does not require a license payment or contact with the
      license server, then you can run your executable on the remote node
      with a command something like what we saw earlier:
      <pre>
        ./run_magic_example.sh /usr/local/matlab 5
      </pre>
      where /usr/local/matlab may need to be changed to wherever
      the MCR has been installed on the remote node.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the way, another possible advantage to using the MATLAB compiler
      is that your program will no longer incur the interactive overhead
      involved with the MATLAB interpreter; it is possible, then, that
      the compiled program will run with an efficiency similar to programs
      compiled in C or FORTRAN, if the interactive version of the program
      was slowed down by a lot of overhead expense.

      <b>MAGICSQUARE</b> is a tiny example of a function that can 
      be compiled.  It expects as input from the user the size N of
      a magic square, calls MATLAB's magic() function, and returns
      the magic square as an output argument.  However, when I ran
      this example, I didn't see the magic square, because the function
      doesn't print it, and I don't know how to "capture" the function's
      output.  So this was a very unsatisfactory example.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "magicsquare.m">magicsquare.m</a>,
          the source code.

          output from running the executable program.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MAGICSQUARE_PRINT</b> repeats the previous example, but
      doesn't bother returning a function value (which I don't know
      how to retrieve or work with).  Instead, I let MATLAB print
      the matrix by default (by removing a semicolon from the previous
      function) and then added some explicit printout statements
      with fprintf(), and luckily, the matrix actually showed up twice
      as output.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "magicsquare_print.m">magicsquare_print.m</a>,
          the source code.

          output from running the executable program.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MAGIC3</b> repeats the previous example, but includes a call to
      a user-written M-file called "timestamp()", which simply prints out
      the data.  I wanted to know that the compiler can handle a program
      that is provided in "pieces".
      <ul>
