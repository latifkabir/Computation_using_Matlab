    <p>
      <b>PIC_SERIAL</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      uses the Particle In Cell (PIC) method to simulate the motion of
      electrically charged particles past a plate.
    </p>

    <p>
      The particle in cell method is appropriate for modeling the behavior
      of a low-density plasma.  Plasmas at high density are modeled using
      magnetohydrodynamics instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is intended as a starting point
      for making a parallel version.
