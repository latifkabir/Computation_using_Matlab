      SPQUAD <br> A Sparse Grid Quadrature Rule
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPQUAD</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      can compute a sparse grid quadrature rule to estimate a multidimensional integral.
      The quadrature rules created by the program are based on the Clenshaw-Curtis rule.
      The code is by Greg von Winckel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original version of this software is available at the Matlab Central File Exchange:
      <a href = "http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19063-sparse-grid-quadrature/content/spquad.m">
                 http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19063-sparse-grid-quadrature/content/spquad.m</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the <b>spquad()</b> function, by default, assumes that the integration region
      is [-1,+1]^d, where <b>d</b> is the spatial dimension.  The function includes an optional
      argument <b>bpt</b>, which is an array allowing the user to specify the lower and upper 
      endpoints of integration.  However, in the experience of the installer, this extra argument
      does not seem to have the correct effect, resulting in quadrature rules that are not
      correctly shifted to the new domain.  A note has been sent to the author asking for
      clarification.  In the meantime, the user can compute the rule for [-1,+1]^d and use a
      simple linear transformation to adjust the points and weights to a nondefault integration region.
