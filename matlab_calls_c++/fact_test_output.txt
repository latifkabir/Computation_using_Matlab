FACT_TEST
  MATLAB version
  Demonstrate a simple use of the MEX compiler,
  which allows MATLAB to call C++ functions.

  Get a directory listing.  The file FACT.CPP should be there.
cheby_u.c	cheby_u_test_output.txt  fact_test.m	       matlab_calls_c.html
cheby_u_test.m	fact.cpp		 fact_test_output.txt


  Compile the file FACT.CPP.

Warning: You are using gcc version "4.4.7".  The version
         currently supported with MEX is "4.3.4".
         For a list of currently supported compilers see: 
         http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/current_release/


  Get a directory listing.  A new file should show up,
  containing the compiled information.
cheby_u.c	cheby_u_test_output.txt  fact.mexa64  fact_test_output.txt
cheby_u_test.m	fact.cpp		 fact_test.m  matlab_calls_c.html


  Now use FACT as though it were a MATLAB M-file function.
