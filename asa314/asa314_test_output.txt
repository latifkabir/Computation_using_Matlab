ASA314_TEST:
  MATLAB version
  Test the ASA314 library.

ASA314_TEST01
  INVMOD computes the inverse of a matrix
  whose elements are subject to modulo arithmetic.

  The matrix to be inverted:

  Col:       1        2        3  
  Row

    1:       1        1        2  
    2:       0        1        0  
    3:       0        0        1  

  The computed inverse:

  Col:       1        2        3  
  Row

    1:       1        2        1  
    2:       0        1        0  
    3:       0        0        1  

  The correct inverse:

  Col:       1        2        3  
  Row

    1:       1        2        1  
    2:       0        1        0  
    3:       0        0        1  

ASA314_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
