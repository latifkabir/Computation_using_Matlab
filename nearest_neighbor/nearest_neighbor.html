      NEAREST_NEIGHBOR <br> Nearest Neighbor from a Set of Points
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NEAREST_NEIGHBOR</b>
      is a MATLAB function which
      works in a given M-dimensional space, seeking, for each point
      in a set S, the nearest point in a set R,
      by Richard Brown.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a nearest neighbor calculation, we are given:
      <p>
        <li>
          R, a set of NR points in M dimensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          S, a set of NS points in M dimensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          D(x,y), a norm for measuring distances between points in M dimensions.
        </li>
      </p>
      and we are asked to compute, for each point S(JS),
      <ul>
        <li>
          JR = NEAREST(JS), the index of the point in R for which
          the distance D(S(JS),R(JR)) is minimized.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously, one method to determine the values in NEAREST is simply to
      compute every distance and take the index of the minimum.  But even
      this simple idea can be implemented in many ways in MATLAB, and 
      implementations will vary in their cost in memory and time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, note that if the dimension M is small, and if the size of the
      R set is small relative to that of S, it may be much cheaper to
      compute the Delaunay triangulation of R (or its higher-dimensional
      generalization).  Computing the triangulation is somewhat expensive,
      but makes the search procedure extremely quick.
    </p>

    <p>
      Richard Brown's function tries to use MATLAB's Delaunay search algorithm
      when it seems preferable, and otherwise computes the nearest neighbor
      by the straightforward approach.
