      GPL_DISPLAY <br> Display Data from Gnuplot GPL Files
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GPL_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      tries to read the data in a typical gnuplot GPL file,
      describing a 1D, 2D or 3D curve, or a surface Z(X,Y) defined
      on a regular grid, a triangular grid, or an irregular quadrilateral grid,
      displays it in a more attractive way than gnuplot is capable of.
    </p>

    <p>
      GNUPLOT does not do a very good job of displaying 3D surfaces.
      It sketches them out with lines, or some simple solid surfaces.
      In some cases, MATLAB can take the same data and make a much
      more attractive image.  This set of programs tries to read a few
      typical GPL data files, and display them appropriately.

      <b>ell</b> is a set of (X,Y,Z(X,Y)) data on a grid of triangles. 
      The GPL file stores this as many sets of 4 lines of data,

      X, Y and Z values for one vertex of a triangle, with the first
      line repeated as the fourth line.  Gnuplot can display this data
      as a 3D surface using the command "splot 'ell.gpl' using lines".

      <b>sine</b> is a set of (X,Y(X)) data over [0,pi],
      tabulating the sine function. 
      The GPL file stores this as 101 pairs of X, Y values.

      <b>solution</b> is a set of (X,Y,Z(X)) data over the unit square,
      representing a solution to the Poisson equation as computed by
      the deal.ii program.  In 2D, the deal.ii program uses a mesh of
      rectangular elements, which need not be of the same size.  Therefore,
      the solution is not stored as a regular grid, but rather as a collection
      of values on little rectangular patches.
      The GPL file stores this as 1024 such patches.  Each patch is recorded
      as the X,Y,Z values at nodes A and B, followed by one blank line,
      and then the X,Y,Z values at nodes C and D, followed by two blank lines.
      The rectangle can be traced by connecting A, B, D and C (in that order).
      Gnuplot can display this data using the command 
      "splot 'solution.gpl' using lines".
      MATLAB can also make a nice surface with the patch() command.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "solution.gpl">solution.gpl</a>, the GPL file.
