      HISTOGRAM_DISCRETE <br> A Histogram of Discrete Data
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HISTOGRAM_DISCRETE</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      creates a histogram of discrete data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The motivation of this study was to explore whether a histogram could
      be made without artificially imposing bins; instead, the original
      data would be kept and handled directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      An attempt was made to come up with a sensible formulation of the
      probability density function (PDF) for data in the range [X_MIN,X_MAX].
      Instead of what amounts to a Dirac delta function, or a discrete bin
      function, a piecewise linear function was devised that tried to emulate
      the distribution of probability density along the interval.  A 
      corresponding piecewise quadratic cumulative density function (CDF)
      was also constructed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because we don't use bins, we can plot the PDF and CDF at any resolution
      we like.  When we do so, the CDF looks reasonable, but the PDF does
      not look so good; a particularly unpleasant example occurs for the
      Gaussian test.  Now we see that binning has the advantage of smoothing
      out the PDF data, whereas our piecewise linear function is too jumpy.
      Presumably, one way to cure this would allow us to retain the piecewise
      linear PDF, while essentially binning the data dynamically, according
      to the resolution of the requested plot.  This, of course, is work to
      be pursued in the vague future.

          that the PDF plot looks very ragged, although the CDF is just fine.
          If is clear that the PDF data needs to be smoothed in some way,
          which is what binning does, for instance.
