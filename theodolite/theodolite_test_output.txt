THEODOLITE_TEST
  MATLAB version
  Test the THEODOLITE library.

THEODOLITE_TEST01
  Estimate the XYZ coordinates of an event in the sky
  observed by 10 scattered stations.

  Seek a position XYZ which minimizes the sum of squares
  of the distance of the event to each of the lines defined
  by an observer's data.

  MATLAB's lsqnonlin() function is used.

  Initial XYZ:

          1245           759         103.5

  Initial F:

       896.509       204.042       1223.81       634.589       1199.83
        764.43       727.419       1160.83       1083.93       703.746
  Initial ||F|| = 2883.85

Local minimum possible.

lsqnonlin stopped because the final change in the sum of squares relative to 
its initial value is less than the default value of the function tolerance.

  Final XYZ:

       950.126       39.5605       999.758

  Final F:

       140.111       60.2398       43.0079       110.537       24.5018
       40.0293       68.6025        11.403       34.4519       72.4477
  Final ||F|| = 225.395

THEODOLITE_TEST
  Normal end of execution.
