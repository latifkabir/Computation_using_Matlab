    <p>
      <b>THEODOLITE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      presents the problem of estimating the location of an event
      which occurs in the sky, atmosphere, or the heavens, using nothing
      but the reported angle of observation from several stations.
      This is an example in which a nonlinear least squares solver is needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <i>theodolite</i> is a tool for accurately measuring the angular
      position of an event.  It can be idealized as a pair of protractors,
      one of which measures an angle in the local horizontal plane,
      with an origin, say, pointing to the north.  The second protractor
      is used to measure the height of the observation.  
    </p>

    <p>
      When a missile is fired at a test facility, its trajectory was followed
      by numerous theodolites at scattered locations.  Measurements made by
      the theodolites, taken at the same time, could be used to estimate the
      actual location of the missile at that time.  Since there were multiple
      measurements available, and the measurements were all subject to some
      error, it is natural to consider applying the least squares method to
      the problem of determining an estimated location that minimizes the
      sum of squared residuals.
