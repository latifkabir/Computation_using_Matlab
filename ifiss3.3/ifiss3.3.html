    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IFISS3.3</b> 
      is a MATLAB program which 
      embodies version 3.3 of the
      Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS), 
      that can model the
      steady (time-independent) flow of a 2D incompressible fluid,
      by Howard Elman, Alison Ramage, David Silvester.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes algorithms for discretization by mixed finite element
      methods and for a posteriori error estimation of the computed solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most recent version of the software may be found by going to
      <a href = "http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~djs/ifiss/">
                 http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~djs/ifiss/ </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      The text of many ACM TOMS algorithms is available online
      through ACM:
              <a href = "http://www.acm.org/pubs/calgo/">
                         http://www.acm.org/pubs/calgo</a> 
      or NETLIB:
      <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/toms/index.html">

    </p>

    <p>
      The four classes of problems that can be solved by this code are identified
      by an alphabetic code:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>P</b>, the Poisson or diffusion equation;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CD</b>, the convection/diffusion equation;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S</b>, the Stokes equations;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NS</b>, the Navier Stokes equation;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are four predefined example problems for the Poisson 
      or diffusion equation:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>P1</b>, diffusion in a square plate;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P2</b>, diffusion in an L-shaped region;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P3</b>, diffusion in the square, with an exact analytic solution;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P4</b>, diffusion in an L-shaped region with an exact analytic solution;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are four predefined example problems for the convection/diffusion equation.
      All problems are posed on a square domain with a convective velocity of order 1:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>CD1</b>, constant convective velocity (0,1), with an exponential
          boundary layer;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CD2</b>, convective velocity (0,1+(x+1)^2/4); characteristic boundary layers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CD3</b>, convective velocity (-sin(pi/6),cos(pi/6)), with a solution
          discontinuity that is smeared by viscosity;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CD4</b>, a simple model for temperature diffusion in a cavity;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The four predefined Stokes problems:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>S1</b>, steady horizontal channel flow, (Poiseuille flow);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S2</b>, slow flow in a rectangular duct with sudden expansion,
          flow over a step;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S3</b>, driven cavity flow;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S4</b>, colliding flow;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The four predefined Navier-Stokes problems:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>S1</b>, steady horizontal channel flow, (Poiseuille flow);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S2</b>, slow flow in a rectangular duct with sudden expansion,
          flow over a step;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S3</b>, driven cavity flow, with a choice of leaky, watertight
          or regularized boundary conditions;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S4</b>, boundary layer flow over a flat plate, (Blasius flow);
        </li>
      </ul>
