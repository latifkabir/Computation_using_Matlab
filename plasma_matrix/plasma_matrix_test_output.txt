PLASMA_MATRIX_TEST
  MATLAB version.
  Create a large sparse plasma matrix and right hand side.
  Store the matrix and right hand side in a Harwell-Boeing file.
  Then retrieve the information.

PLASMA_MATRIX_TEST01
  Linear order of spatial grid = 5
  Number of grid points is 25
  Approximate number of nonzero matrix entries is 125.
  Full storage matrix would require 625 entries.

  Sparsity image saved as "plasma_5_sparsity.png"

  Norm of solution is 0.315693

  Matrix and right hand side saved in Harwell-Boeing
  format file "plasma_5_rua.txt"

  After writing the linear system to a file, and 
  retrieving it, the norm of the solution is 0.315693

PLASMA_MATRIX_TEST01
  Linear order of spatial grid = 100
  Number of grid points is 10000
  Approximate number of nonzero matrix entries is 50000.
  Full storage matrix would require 100000000 entries.

  Sparsity image saved as "plasma_100_sparsity.png"

  Norm of solution is 29.5723

  Matrix and right hand side saved in Harwell-Boeing
  format file "plasma_100_rua.txt"

  After writing the linear system to a file, and 
  retrieving it, the norm of the solution is 29.5723

PLASMA_MATRIX_TEST
  Normal end of execution.
