TSEARCH_TEST
  MATLAB version.
  Test various TSEARCH-like functions.

TSEARCH_TEST01
  For searching a Delaunay triangulation,
  TSEARCH is an obsolete Matlab function
  MYTSEARCH was an "improved" preprocessor to TSEARCH;
  TSEARCH_MEX is an equivalent C code in a MEX file.
  PointLocation works with the new Delaunay function.

  Evaluate those functions that are available
  and compare the results.
Warning: TSEARCH will be removed in a future release. Use DelaunayTri/pointLocation
instead.
