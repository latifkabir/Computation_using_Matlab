      TSEARCH <br> Replacing MATLAB's TSEARCH() Function
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TSEARCH</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      compares several replacements for MATLAB's obsolete tsearch() function,
      which searched a Delaunay triangulation to find the triangle
      that encloses a given point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a set of points P, it is possible to compute the Delaunay
      triangulation D(P), and then to very efficiently answer the question,
      what triangle T in D(P) contains a query point Q?
    </p>

    <p>
      In earlier versions of MATLAB, this could be done by the following calls:
      <pre>
        d = delaunay ( px, py );
        t = tsearch ( px, py, d, qx, qy ); 
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A MATLAB function mytsearch() was written, which allows the user to
      supply an initial guess for the triangle; if the guess is incorrect,
      then tsearch() is called to find the correct answer.
      <pre>
        d = delaunay ( px, py );
        t = guess values;
        t = tsearch_mex ( px, py, d, qx, qy, t ); 
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A C function has been made available, which follows MATLAB's MEX
      interface standards, and which can also be used for this computation:
      <pre>
        d = delaunay ( px, py );
        t = tsearch_mex ( px, py, d, qx, qy ); 
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      But now tsearch() has been deleted, and the recommended calls are:
      <pre>
        d = DelaunayTri ( p );
        t = PointLocation ( d, q); 
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The main purpose of the files in this directory is to examine the
      behavior of these various options.

          a "front end" to MATLAB's tsearch(), intended to improve its
          performance.  If the user supplies a valid initial guess for
          each query point, then mytsearch() can execute without calling
          tsearch().  This function was written by Darren Engwirda.

          random number generator, and is easy to run on different machines.

          a C function which follows MATLAB's MEX interface requirements,
          and so can be compiled with MATLAB's MEX utility and used
          as a substitute for tsearch().
