      NAVIER_STOKES_MESH2D<br> 2D Meshes for Navier Stokes Problems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>NAVIER_STOKES_MESH2D</b> 
      is a set of MATLAB data files defining meshes for several
      2D test problems involving the Navier Stokes equations
      for fluid flow, provided by Leo Rebholz.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are interested in these meshes as useful tests for a procedure
      in which we are able to redo the related Navier Stokes calculations
      using FENICS.  
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of that task, we need to take the meshes
      associated with the MATLAB computation and translate them into 
      a format acceptable to DOLFIN / FENICS.  Our proposed mechanism
      for this is either to translate the files to the Gmsh msh format,
      and then use DOLFIN-CONVERT to convert that to DOLFIN XML,
      or else to translate the files directly into DOLFIN XML format ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following files each contain a mesh, defined by
      a node coordinate list, a node index list for each element, and boundary nodes.
      The first line of the file lists the number of nodes, the number of elements,
      and the number of boundary segments.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Each node coordinate line lists the 3D coordinates of a node.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each element line lists 3 node indices forming the element, plus an
      integer tag that seems to be 0 always.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each boundary segment line lists two node indices that form a line segment
      along the boundary, plus an integer tag that probably is used to specify the
      boundary condition applied along that line.
