%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% DISCRETE_PDF_SAMPLE_2D creates and samples a discrete PDF.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This program is an example of how discrete sample or density data
%    can be used to define a PDF (probability density function). 
%
%    In this function and the functions it calls, we assume that we have
%    data for an array of 20 by 20 square subcells of the unit square.
%    We wish to derive a PDF that will allow us to sample an arbitrary
%    number of points from this region.
%
%    In particular, we intend to use the discrete data to generate a PDF
%    which we will then use to generate sample points.
%
%    Roughly speaking, we have kept track of how many fish we caught in
%    each part of a lake, and now we want to simulate catching N fish
%    under the same conditions.
%
%    The statistics for each simulation should be governed by the discrete
%    PDF, but with random variation.  In other words, the actual number
%    of points taken from each subregion is random, and the actual location of
%    each point in a subregion is random, but over many simulations, the
%    statistics of the sample points should reproduce the statistics of
%    the original discrete sample that defined the PDF.

%% DISCRETE_CDF_TO_XY finds XY points corresponding to discrete CDF values.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    This program is given a discrete CDF function and a set of N random
%    values U.  Each value of U corresponds to a particular (I,J) subregion
%    whose CDF value just exceeds the value of U.  Inside that subregion,
%    we pick a point at random - this is equivalent to assuming the PDF
%    is constant over the subregion.
%
%    This function is part of an example program, for which various
%    assumptions have been made.  In particular, the region is the unit
%    square, and the subregions are formed by a 20 by 20 grid of equal
%    subsquares.
