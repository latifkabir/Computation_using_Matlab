      BVP4C <br> Automatic Solution of 1D Boundary Value Problems (IBVP's)
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BVP4C</b>
      is a directory of MATLAB programs which
      illustrate how to use the MATLAB command <b>bvp4c()</b>, which can solve
      boundary value problems (BVP's) in one spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Example of a 1D Boundary Value Problem:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A simple two point boundary value problem involves a second degree
      differential equation 
      <pre>
        y"(x) = f(x,y)
      </pre>
      which is to hold over some interval 
      <pre>
        a < x < b 
      </pre> 
      with
      boundary conditions
      <pre>
        y(a) = ya
        y(b) = yb
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Defining an Initial Guess for the Solution
    </h3>

    <p>
      The solution to your boundary value problem begins by specifying
      an initial guess for the solution.  If the problem is linear, or only mildly
      nonlinear, then a simple guess may be sufficient.  For difficult problems,
      it may be necessary to exert some effort to preparing a good initial guess.
      The guess function is a MATLAB structure, which is typically defined by
      a call to <b>bvpinit()</b> as follows:
      <pre>
        solinit = bvpinit ( xinit, yinit, parameters )
      </pre>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>xinit</i> is a vector of x values which begin with the left endpoint
          and conclude with the right endpoint.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>yinit</i> is a vector of M values.  The initial guess for the solution
          and its first M-1 derivatives will be constant functions with the values
          yinit(1) through yinit(M).
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>yinit</i> can instead be a function handle, in which case it must be written
          in such a way that it accepts a scalar value x, and returns a vector
          containing the M components of the initial guess at x.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>parameters</i> is a vector of initial guesses for unknown parameters.
          This argument is optional, and is usually omitted.  It is useful, however,
          when solving eigenvalue problems.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Computing a Solution Estimate
    </h3>

    <p>
      Once the solution guess has been defined, the simplest call to 
      <b>bvp4c()</b> has the form
      <pre>
        sol = bvp4c ( odefun, bcfun, solinit )
      </pre>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>odefun</i> is the handle for a function that evaluates the differential
          equation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>bcfun</i> is the handle for a function that evaluates the boundary conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>solinit</i> is a structure containing the initial guess for
          the solution, as returned by <b>bvpinit()</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest call to the user-written function <b>odefun()</b> has the form
      <pre>
        dydx = odefun ( x, y )
      </pre>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>x</i> is a scalar value where the ODE is to be evaluated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>y</i> contains the M components of the solution estimate at x.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>dydx</i> is a column M-vector containing the right hand side of
          the first-order differential equations.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest call to the user-written function <b>bcfun()</b> has the form
      <pre>
        res = bcfun ( ya, yb )
      </pre>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>ya, yb</i> are M component vectors of the solution estimates
          at the left and right endpoints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>res</i> is a column M-vector containing the residual of the
          boundary conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Evaluating the Computed Solution
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>bvp4c()</b> function returns as output the quantity <i>sol</i>,
      which contains information that can be used to evaluate the solution
      components at any point in the domain.  To do this, however, you must
      invoke the <b>deval()</b> function.  For instance, if the solution has
      been computed over the interval [0,4], and we wish to evaluate the
      solution y(x) at 101 evenly spaced points within that interval, then 
      the sequence of commands might be:
      <pre>
        solinit = bvpinit ( xinit, yinit );
        sol = bvp4c ( odefun, bcfun, solinit );
        x = linspace ( 0.0, 4.0, 101 );
        y = deval ( sol, x );
        plot ( x, y(1,:) );
      </pre> 
      Note that <b>deval</b> evaluates all M components of the solution.
      In the common case of a second order BVP, y(1,:) would contain the
      solution, and y(2,:) the derivative of the solution, at each point x.
