      Display Smolyak Sparse Grid Construction
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SMOLYAK_DISPLAY</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      displays the exactness diagram for a 2D Smolyak sparse grid,
      by displaying and summing the exactness diagrams for the
      component product rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exactness diagram is a plot of the monomials <b>x^i y^j</b>
      which are exactly integrated by the sparse grid.  The sparse grid
      "inherits" its exactness from the product rules that compose it,
      and the program shows how this is done.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1D, a quadrature rule Q() is a list of N points X and weights W
      which approximates an integral I(f) over some region by
      <pre>
        I(f) is approximated by Q(f) = sum ( 1 <= i <= n ) w(i) * f(x(i))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2D (or higher), a product quadrature rule is the most common method 
      for estimating integrals in this way.
      A product rule in 2D is formed by taking two rules for 1D
      quadrature, say Q1 and Q2, and forming the rule Q = Q1 x Q2.
      Here, the points of the rule Q are formed by taking all possible
      pairs (x1,x2), with weights w1*w2.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Smolyak sparse grid is generally used to form a quadrature
      rule Q(f) to approximate the integral I(f) of a multivariate 
      function f(x) over a domain that is a product region.  Although
      Smolyak grids are related to product rules, they generally are
      able to produce accurate estimates at a much lower "cost",
      that is, with a much smaller number of points N.
    </p>

    <p>
      Typically, for a given spatial dimension D, Smolyak sparse grids
      are available in a sequence of sizes called "levels".  Level 0
      is a single point rule, and subsequent levels add more points and
      more accurate integral estimates.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2D, a Smolyak grid is a combination created by adding together
      product rules of a given product level, and subtracting product
      rules of the previous level.
    </p>

    <p>
      One way to analyze the behavior of a sequence of sparse grids is to 
      investigate their exactness.
    </p>

    <p>
      A quadrature rule is exact for an integrand <b>f(x)</b>
      if it is true that <b>Q(f)=I(f)</b>.  Typically, for a 1D quadrature
      rule, we are interested in the exactness for monomials of the
      form <b>x^j</b>, and a quadrature rule has exactness up to degree
      <b>k</b> if it is exact for all monomials from <b>x^0</b> through
      <b>x^k</b>.  This immediately implies that the quadrature rule
      will be exact for any polynomial of degree <b>k</b> or less, and
      hence is strong information about the approximation ability of the rule.  
    </p>

    <p>
      An exactness diagram for a quadrature rule can be made, which displays
      all the monomials which the rule can integrate exactly.  Since we
      are considering a Smolyak sparse grid, we can display the evolution
      of the exactness diagram, as we add or subtract each component
      product grid to the sparse grid.  The program draws a black diagonal
      line to mark the total degree exactness of the sparse grid.  It shows
      in dark blue the monomials which can be exactly integrated by the rule,
      and which lie below the exactness line.  Light blue is used for monomials
      that can be integrated exactly, but which lie above the exactness line;
      these represent, in some sense, superfluous accuracy.  Until the sparse
      grid is completely constructed, some monomials under the exactness line
      may actually be incorrectly estimated at double, or triple, or minus
      their true value.  This is suggested by using other colors for such
      monomials.  However, once the sparse grid is complete, the entire
      field of monomials below the diagonal line should be dark blue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two "families" of quadrature rules are available:
    </p>

    <p>
      The Clenshaw-Curtis
      family is defined on [-1,+1].  Roughly speaking, the rule with N points
      has exactness N-1.  Actually, because of symmetric, if N is odd, then
      the rule with N points will actually have exactness N.  In particular,
      the rule with 1 point has exactness 1, and can integrate both constants
      (degree 0) and linear functions (degree 1) exactly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Legendre family is defined on [-1,+1].  The rule with N points
      has exactness 2*N-1.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the families can produce rules of any size, we wish to select
      a subsequence of these rules, which increase in size to satisfy
      some pattern we specify.  This pattern is called the "growth rate".
      A common growth rate is "exponential", in which the number of points
      roughly doubles on each step.  For technical reasons, the Clenshaw-Curtis
      and Legendre families differ in how they grow exponentially.  Other
      simple growth rules include "slow exponential", "linear", and "linear odd".
    </p>

    <p>
      The "hyperbolic cross" growth rule is quite different from the others.
      Essentially, when we specify a level L, the 2D product rules that we will
      be combining for the hyperbolic cross involve sizes L1 and L2 whose
      product is L (or close to it).  Thus, the hyperbolic cross grid of
      level 5 adds: +Q(1)xQ(6) + Q(2)xQ(3) + Q(3)xQ(2) + Q(6)xQ(1)
      and subtracts: -Q(1)xQ(3)-Q(2)xQ(2)-Q(3)xQ(1).  This growth rule is
      appropriate for integrand functions which are biases towards pure
      powers of a single variable (x or y in our case) and against powers
      that involve both x and y.
