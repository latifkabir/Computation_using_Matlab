      SQUARE_HEX_GRID <br> Hexagonally Staggered Grid Points in a Square
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SQUARE_HEX_GRID</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      computes a hexagonally staggered grid of points
      over the interior of a square in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      For one set of routines, the hexagonal grid is defined in the
      unit square [0,1] x [0,1].  For a matching set of routines,
      the hexagonal grid is defined on a coordinate box [A,B] x [C,D].
    </p>

    <p>
      All nodes of the grid lie on one of <b>LAYERS</b> horizontal lines.
      The first of these lines is the X axis (for grids in the unit square)
      or the line from (A,C) to (B,C), for grids in a coordinate box.
      Each successive line is <b>HY</b> units higher.
    </p>

    <p>
      On all the odd numbered lines, there are <b>NODES_PER_LAYER</b> points,
      equally spaced from 0 to 1 or A to B, with a spacing of <b>HX</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the even numbered lines, there are <b>NODES_PER_LAYER</b>-1 points,
      whose values are the midpoints of successive intervals on
      an odd numbered line.  (The grid is staggered).
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to maintain the hexagonal structure, the following relationship
      is required between <b>HX</b> and <b>HY</b>:
      <pre>
        <b>HY</b> = <b>HX</b> * sqrt ( 3 ) / 2.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an image of a hexagonal grid with <b>NODES_PER_ROW</b> = 21
      and <b>LAYERS</b> = 24, and a total of <b>N</b> = 492 nodes.
