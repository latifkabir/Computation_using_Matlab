OU_EULER_TEST:
  Estimate a solution to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation
  using the Euler method for stochastic differential equations.

  Using decay rate THETA = 2
  Using mean MU = 1
  Using variance SIGMA = 0.15
  Using initial value X0 = 2
  Using final time TMAX = 3

OU_EULER:
  MATLAB version
  Use an Euler method to approximate the solution of
  the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation:

    d x(t) = theta * ( mu - x(t) ) dt + sigma dW

  with initial condition x(0) = x0.
