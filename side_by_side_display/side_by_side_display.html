    <p>
      <b>SIDE_BY_SIDE_DISPLAY</b>
      shows MATLAB programs which
      display curves side by side in a 3D plot;
      the curves might be yearly snowfall data over consecutive years, 
      for instance.

    <p>
      The <b>SNOWFALL</b> example works with a database of snowfall data from
      Michigan Tech.  The idea is to extract the records for the years 2000
      through 2010, and show them together.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "snowfall.txt">snowfall.txt</a>, 
          the snowfall data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "snowfall_display.m">snowfall_display.m</a>,
          a program which reads the snowfall data and creates the plot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "snowfall.png">snowfall.png</a>, 
          the snowfall plot.
