MATLAB_MISTAKE_TEST
  MATLAB version
  Test the MATLAB_MISTAKE library.

MATLAB_MISTAKE01:
  Set X(I) = 1 / ( I - 5 ) for I = 1 to 10
  but set X(5) to zero.

  Now let's print out X!

  X(1) = 0
  X(2) = 0
  X(3) = 0
  X(4) = 0
  X(5) = 0
  X(6) = 0
  X(7) = 0
  X(8) = 0
  X(9) = 0
  X(10) = 0

  That was NOT what we expected!

MATLAB_MISTAKE_TEST
  Normal end of execution.
