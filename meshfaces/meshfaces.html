      MESHFACES <br> Automatic 2D Mesh Generation for Several Faces
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>MESH2D</b>
      is a MATLAB program which generates
      unstructured meshes in 2D for a regeion which has been subdivided
      into several faces,
      by Darren Engwirda.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is based on MESH2D, and can be regarded as an extension of
      the program to handle the additional constraint that the internal
      boundaries shared by pairs of faces are required to be covered by
      edges of the mesh triangles.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
          [ <i>p, t, fnum, stats</i> ] = <b>meshfaces</b> ( <i>node, edge, hdata, options</i> );
      </blockquote>
      where:
      <ul>
        <li>s
          <i>node</i>, an N by 2 list of (X,Y) coordinates of
          node, used to dilineate the faces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>edge</i>, an E by 2 list of pairs of indices that constitute 
          edges of the faces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>faces</i>, a cell array of F entries.  F{i} is a vector containing
          a list of the edges, in counterclockwise order, that form the boundary
          of the i-th face.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>hdata</i>, optional input, a structure containing element size 
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>options</i>, optional input that allows the user to modify the 
          default behavior of the solver.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>p</i>, a NP by 2 list of the points used to define the mesh.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>t</i>, an NT by 3 list of point indices, forming counterclockwise
          triangles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>fnum</i>, an NT vector which indicates the face to which each 
          triangle belongs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>stats</i>, the computational time, average and minimum triangle 
          quality, number of points and number of triangles.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
