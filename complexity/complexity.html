      COMPLEXITY <br> Execution Time as a Function of Problem Size
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COMPLEXITY</b> 
      is a set of MATLAB programs which
      investigate the time complexity of a few simple calculations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time complexity can refer to the relationship between problem size <b>n</b>
      and execution time <b>t</b>.  Algorithms may exhibit logarithmic,
      linear, quadratic, or exponential time complexity.  A quadratic time
      complexity suggests that a formula such as <b>t = a + b * n + c * n^2</b>.
      However, there is no point in trying to be so precise, and the important
      feature here is the occurrence of <b>n^2</b>, whose growth rate will 
      eventually characterize the function.  Thus, we tend to simplify such a
      relationship by writing <b>t=O(n^2)</b>, saying "t is of the order of
      the square of n".  A more subtle complexity might have the form 
      <b>t = O(n * log(n) )</b>, which is a form that actually occurs fairly often.
    </p>

    <p>
      For short, simple algorithms, it is possible to work out the time complexity
      as a formula.  However, practical algorithms often have complications that make
      it tedious to seek such a formula.  Moreover, the computer implementation
      and the memory access patterns may also have a pronounced effect on the
      behavior of a program, particularly when the problem size is large.  Thus,
      whether we can predict or estimate the time complexity of an algorithm, we
      can experimentally measure it on a range of problem sizes and draw our own
      conclusions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this directory, we consider a few simple algorithms, using them to solve
      problems of increasing size, measuring the elapsed time, and making plots.
