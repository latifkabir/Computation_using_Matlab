      FE2D_PREDATOR_PREY_FAST<br>
      Predator-prey simulations in arbitrary shaped 2D habitats
    </h1>
    
    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FE2D_PREDATOR_PREY_FAST</b>
      is a MATLAB library which
      implements finite element solvers for predator prey simulations
      with time and 2D spatial dependence
      over an arbitrary domain that has been triangulated.  A variety of
      boundary conditions may be specified.  The solvers integrate the
      associated partial differential equations over a given time interval,
      and create plots of the predator and prey population densities at
      the final time.
    </p>

    <p>
      These codes are a finite element generalization of earlier MATLAB
      algorithms developed using finite difference methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      The algorithms presented here are "fast" versions of scripts that were
      originally written by Marcus Garvie, of the University of Guelph.
      They have been modified by John Burkardt to run much more quickly.
