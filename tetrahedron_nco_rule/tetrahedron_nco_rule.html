      TETRAHEDRON_NCO_RULE <br> Newton-Cotes Open Quadrature for the Tetrahedron
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TETRAHEDRON_NCO_RULE</b>
      is a MATLAB library which 
      defines the weights and abscisass for a sequence of
      7 Newton-Cotes open quadrature rules 
      over the interior of a tetrahedron in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      Newton-Cotes rules have the characteristic that the abscissas
      are equally spaced.  For a tetrahedron, this refers to spacing
      in the unit reference tetrahedron, or in the barycentric coordinate
      system.  These rules may be mapped to an arbitrary tetrahedron,
      and will still be valid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rules are said to be "open" when they do not include points on
      the boundary of the tetrahedron.
    </p>

    <p>
      The use of equally spaced abscissas may be important for your
      application.  That may how your data was collected, for instance.
      On the other hand, the use of equally spaced abscissas carries
      a few costs.  In particular, for a given degree of polynomial
      accuracy, there will be rules that achieve this accuracy, but
      use fewer abscissas than Newton-Cotes.  Moreover, the Newton-Cotes
      approach almost always results in negative weights for some
      abscissas.  This is generally an undesirable feature, particularly
      when higher order quadrature rules are being used.
