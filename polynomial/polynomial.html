      POLYNOMIAL <br> Multivariate Polynomials

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>POLYNOMIAL</b>,
      a MATLAB library which
      adds, multiplies, differentiates, evaluates and prints multivariate 
      polynomials in a space of M dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any polynomial in M variables can be written as a linear
      combination of monomials in M variables.  The "total degree" of the
      polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of the monomials that it
      comprises.  For instance, a polynomial in M = 2 variables of total
      degree 3 might have the form:
      <pre>
        p(x,y) = c(0,0) x^0 y^0
               + c(1,0) x^1 y^0 + c(0,1) x^0 y^1 
               + c(2,0) x^2 y^0 + c(1,1) x^1 y^1 + c(0,2) x^0 y^2
               + c(3,0) x^3 y^0 + c(2,1) x^2 y^1 + c(1,2) x^1 y^2 + c(0,3) x^0 y^3
      </pre>
      The monomials in M variables can be regarded as 
      a natural basis for the polynomials in M variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      When listing the monomials that form a polynomial, it is useful to have 
      an ordering that organizes them.  One natural ordering can be illustrated
      for the 3-dimensional case:
      <pre>
        1
        x, y, z
        x^2, xy, xz, y^2, yz, z^2
        x^3, x^2y, x^2z, xy^2, xyz, xz^2, y^3, y^2z, yz^2, z^3
        x^4, x^3y, ...
      </pre>
      Here, a monomial precedes another if it has a lower degree.
      If the monomials have the same degree, then a monomial precedes another
      if its exponent vector lexically precedes that of the other.  In other
      words, we compare the two exponent vectors, reading from left to right,
      looking for the first location where the exponents differ.  The monomial
      with the higher exponent at this point precedes the other.
