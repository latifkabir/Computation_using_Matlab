    <p>
      <b>FLAME_ODE</b> 
      is a MATLAB library which 
      considers an ordinary differential equation (ODE) which models
      the growth of a ball of flame in a combustion process.

      <b>UNIFORM_RUN</b> solves the problem multiple times, using a value of DELTA that
      is the product of the base value 0.01 times a factor whose logarithm base 2 varies
      uniformly between -1 and 1.  The quantity of interest Q is the time at which the
      solution reaches the value 0.99.  The program plots the solution curves, as well as
      the observed values of Q as a function of DELTA.

      <b>QOI_QUAD</b> assumes that the actual value of DELTA can be written as
      DELTA = 2^U*DELTA_BASE, where DELTA_BASE is 0.01 and U is a number that
      is uniformly distributed in [-1,+1].  We now seek to estimate the expected
      value of the quantity of interest using a Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule
      to select values of U, compute the quantity of interest, and weight them.
