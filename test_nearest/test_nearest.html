      TEST_NEAREST <br> Test Functions for the Nearest Neighbor Calculation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TEST_NEAREST</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      tests several functions that carry out the nearest neighbor calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a nearest neighbor calculation, we are given:
      <p>
        <li>
          R, a set of NR points in M dimensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          S, a set of NS points in M dimensions.
        </li>
        <li>
          D(x,y), a norm for measuring distances between points in M dimensions.
        </li>
      </p>
      and we are asked to compute, for each point S(JS),
      <ul>
        <li>
          JR = NEAREST(JS), the index of the point in R for which
          the distance D(S(JS),R(JR)) is minimized.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously, one method to determine the values in NEAREST is simply to
      compute every distance and take the index of the minimum.  But even
      this simple idea can be implemented in many ways in MATLAB, and 
      implementations will vary in their cost in memory and time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, note that if the dimension M is small, and if the size of the
      R set is small relative to that of S, it may be much cheaper to
      compute the Delaunay triangulation of R (or its higher-dimensional
      generalization).  Computing the triangulation is somewhat expensive,
      but makes the search procedure extremely quick.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lloyd's version of the Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) algorithm
      estimates the area or volume of the cells using sampling.  This computation
      is a nearest neighbor calculation.
