receiving this letter provided you send it
on.  This is no joke.  Do not send money,
faith has no price.

Do not keep this letter.  It must leave
your hands within 96 hours.  An R.A.F.
Officer received $470,000.  Jon Eliot 
received $40,000 and lost it because he broke
the chain.  While in the Philippines, George
Hish lost his wife 51 days after receiving
the letter.  He had failed to circulate the 
letter.  However, before her death he had 
received $7,775,000.00

Please send 20 copies.  After a few days
you will get a surprise.  This is true even if
you are not superstitious.  Do note the 
following: Constantine Dias received the chain in
1953.  He asked his secretary to make 20
copies and send them.  A few days later he
won the lottery of two million dollars.

Dolan Fairchild received the letter and
not believing, he threw the letter away.
Nine days later he died.

Do not ignore this.  It works.
