An R.A.F. Officer received $70,000.00.  Joe Elliott received $450,000.00 and 
lost it because he broke the chain. While in the Phillipines General Welch 
lost his wife six days after he received the letter.  He failed to circulate 
the prayer. However, before his death he received $775,000.00.

Please send 20 copies and see what happens to you on the 4th day. This chain 
comes from Venezuela and was written by Saul Anthony de Croil, a missionary 
from South America. I myself forward it to you. Since the chain must make the 
tour of the world, you must make 20 copies identical to this one. Send it to 
your friends, parents or associates. After a few days you will get a surprise. 
This is true even if you are not superstitious. 

Take note of the following: Constantine Dias received the chain
in 1953. He asked his secretary to make 20 copies and send them. A few days 
later, he won a lottery for $2,000,000.00 In his country. Carlo Deditt, an 
office employee, received his chain,he forgot it and a few days later lost his 
job. He found the chain letter and sent it to 20 people. Five days later he 
got an even better job. Delon Fairchild received the chain and not believing 
in it, threw it away. Nine days later, he died. For no reason whatsoever should 
this chain be broken. Remember, send no money. 

Please do not ignor this. It works.
