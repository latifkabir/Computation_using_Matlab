      FEM2D_BVP_QUADRATIC <br> Finite Element Method, 2D, Boundary Value Problem, Piecewise Quadratic Elements
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_BVP_QUADRATIC</b>
      is a MATLAB program which
      applies the finite element method, with piecewise quadratic elements,
      to a 2D boundary value problem over a rectangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boundary value problem (BVP) that is to be solved has the form:
      <pre>
        - d/dx ( a(x,y) * du/dx ) - d/dy ( a(x,y) * du/dy ) + c(x,y) * u(x,y) = f(x,y)
      </pre>
      This equation holds in the interior of some rectangle R.
      The functions a(x,y), c(x,y), and f(x,y) are given.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zero boundary conditions are imposed on the boundary of R.
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute a finite element approximation, the X and Y extents of R
      are gridded with NX and NY equally spaced values, respectively,
      where both NX and NY must be odd.
      This defines NX*NY nodes, and divides R into ((NX-1)/2)*((NY-1)/2) 
      rectangular elements.  At the K-th node, (X(I),Y(J)), a piecewise 
      quadratic basis function PHI(K)(X,Y) is defined.  The solution will be
      represented as a linear combination of these basis functions.  An 
      integral form of the BVP is written, in which the differential equation 
      is multiplied by each basis function, and integration by parts is
      used to simplify the integrand.
